How to form an interferogram by SNAP processor and qualify it to understand the Earthquake in BAM city

SAR data is available at: https://zenodo.org/record/6637432

Differential InSAR is a satellite-based remote sensing technique that can be used to quantify small displacements of the Earth's surface. This is due to the interferometric phase being much more sensitive to the ground motion than to the elevation difference. 

This practical session will explain how to apply it to real-world Envisat ASAR images, with user-oriented open-source SNAP software. The main goal is able to generate ground motion from a pair of SAR images to map the Earthquake of 2003 in BAM city.  

The basics of the InSAR technique can be found in the "Introduction to SAR Interferometry" video
